# AllPassport

The #1 stop-shop for all your Passport Authentication needs. Ready to login, signup, password reset, social login/signup? Welcome.

# What is it?

AllPassport is a combination of bits and pieces of the Passport authentication framework, cooked properly, with the needed spices using the right recipe.

# What you get?
- **Social Authentication**: By default, AllPassport comes shipped with the ability to login via Local, Google, Facebook and Twitter
- **Passwords:* reset, change, forgotten, whatever
- **Emails:** set primary email, verify email and even verifying the web exist. The last one isn't true.
- Link/Unlink social accounts to local
- **One paged login/signup/social-login**. On a single page is all your authentication forms. Call it a 'one-stop shop'
- **Uses Swig** - Think of it as 'Swag'.
- **Seamless theme**: A seamless login/signup forms to match almost any theme of yours. You may throw in your favorites too.
- **Ooh dear, AngularJS**: Rigged to play nice with AngularJS. Continue building the app using the Swig template engine, or let AngularJS take over

# How does it actually work?

In simple terms, AllPassport handles all your authentication needs. It uses Swig template engine to render the authentication aspects, then renders a template you could use in your actual app.
